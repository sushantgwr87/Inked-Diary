# :warning: Important Note :warning:
Since Heroku has stopped free hosting, json server has been taken down. Database has been removed currently so no data will be shown.

# Inked Diary
A Blog website made using React.js which is backed by json server database.

## Algorithm

### Main Route
App.js contains all routes for pages

### Hooks and states
usefetch.js contains main algo to retreive needed data from json database hosted on a json server. useState and useEffect are used to control changes in database and loading of data retreived. 

### Database
Json server database is used here. Check my repo [inked-database](https://github.com/sushantgwr87/inked-database/tree/master) for more details.
